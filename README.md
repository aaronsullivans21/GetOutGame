# My Projects Completed in Highschool

## Get Out Game: get_out_game.js
This is a small game I made as a part of a class project, in which it was made using JavaScript and then executed with code studio. This game takes users on a surrealistic journed of trying to solve a virtual escape room.

## Drawing a Boat: drawing_a_boat.js
This is a small application I made as another class project in which it is written in JavaScript and it procedurally draws an image of a boat.
